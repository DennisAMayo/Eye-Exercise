# Eye Balls

This is an interactive code that allows the eye balls to follow your mouse around the screen.  After completing the orignal exercise I added some css to change the eye color and background.  Also i added pupils on the eyes to make it more realistic.  In future updates I want to try and add more facial features and have each eye move independently instead of moving based off the center of the screen.

## How to Run
Open up the <a href="https://dennisamayo.github.io/Eye-Exercise/">Eye Exercise</a>.  The set of eyes will follow around your mouse screen while inside the browser.


## Future Releases

- Make the eyes move based of them being the center point instead of the middle of the screen.
